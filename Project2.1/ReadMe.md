#Projext 2: Text and Geo Spatial Visualization

## Data Preprocessing:

The data sets used for the visualization were from the 'WikiNews' and 'Huffington Post' websites.
The same approach was used for both the dataset for preprocessing.

Preprocessing in various phases as explained below:

1. **Getting Frequency Count For Every Word** : In this phase,
    - we read all the records avaiable in the datasets,
    - parse the extract words,
    - keep a counter for each word, that increments when the same word appears again.
    - Then we allow the use to download the same processed data as a .csv file using the 'FrequencyCounter - huffington.html' or 'FrequencyCounter.html' pages.
